# HTTP API V2

## Theory

The Docker Registry HTTP API is the protocol to facilitate distribution of images to the docker engine. It interacts with instances of the docker registry, which is a service to manage information about docker images and enable their distribution. The specification covers the operation of version 2 of this API, known as Docker Registry HTTP API V2.
