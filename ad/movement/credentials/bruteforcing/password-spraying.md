# Spraying

Credential spraying is a technique that attackers use to try a few passwords (or keys) against a set of usernames instead of a single one. This technique is just [credential guessing](broken-reference) but "sprayed" (i.e. against multiple accounts) and tools that can do [credential guessing](broken-reference) can usually do spraying.
