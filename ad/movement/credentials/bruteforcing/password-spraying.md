# Spraying

Credential spraying is a technique that attackers use to try a few passwords \(or keys\) against a set of usernames instead of a single one. This technique is just [credential guessing](guessing.md) but "sprayed" \(i.e. against multiple accounts\) and tools that can do [credential guessing](guessing.md) can usually do spraying.
