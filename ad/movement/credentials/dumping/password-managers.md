# Password managers

# Intro 

A password manager is an application to store and manage users' login information for local and Internet websites and services. Since it deals with users' data, it must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. 

Examples of Password Manager applications:

   - Built-in password managers (Windows)
   - Third-party: KeePass, 1Password, LastPass

However, misconfiguration and security flaws are found in these applications that let adversaries access stored data. Various tools could be used during the enumeration stage to get sensitive data in password manager applications used by Internet browsers and desktop applications.
