## Theory

Bluetooth is a short-range [wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless) technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances and building [personal area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network) (PANs). In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 [milliwatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliwatt), giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft). It employs [UHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency) [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave) in the [ISM bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band), from 2.402 [GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHz) to 2.48 GHz
