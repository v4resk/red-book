# MITM and coerced auths

These techniques enable attackers to redirect traffic or redirect/force targets authentications. Attackers will then be able, in certain cases, to capture credentials or relay authentications. I'm using "coerce" instead of "force" in this category's title since some technique can rely on a bit of social engineering to work.
