# GLIBC Exploits

## Theory

The GNU C Library, commonly known as glibc, is the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU\_Project)'s implementation of the [C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\_standard\_library). It is a wrapper around the system calls of the Linux kernel for application use. Despite its name, it now also directly supports [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) (and, indirectly, other [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming\_language)). It was started in the 1980s by the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\_Software\_Foundation) (FSF) for the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) operating system.
