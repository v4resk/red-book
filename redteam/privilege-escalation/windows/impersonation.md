# Impersonation

When credentials are found (through [dumping](../../../ad/movement/credentials/dumping/) or [cracking](../../../ad/movement/credentials/cracking.md) for instance), attackers try to use them to obtain access to new resources. Depending on the harvested credential material type, the impersonation can be done in different ways.
