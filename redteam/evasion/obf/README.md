# üõ†Ô∏èObfuscation

## Theory

To document and organize the variety of obfuscation methods, we can reference the [Layered obfuscation: a taxonomy of software obfuscation techniques for layered security paper](https://cybersecurity.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s42400-020-00049-3.pdf). This research paper organizes obfuscation methods by layers, similar to the OSI model but for application data flow. Below is the figure used as the complete overview of each taxonomy layer.

Each sub-layer is then broken down into specific methods that can achieve the overall objective of the sub-layer.
