# Windows Sysinternals

## Theory

[Windows Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) is a set of tools and advanced system utilities developed to help IT professionals manage, troubleshoot, and diagnose the Windows operating system in various advanced topics.

While built-in and Sysinternals tools are helpful for system administrators, these tools are also used by hackers, malware, and pentesters due to the inherent trust they have within the operating system. This trust is beneficial to Red teamers, who do not want to get detected or caught by any security control on the target system. Therefore, these tools have been used to evade detection and other blue team controls.

Sysinternals Suite is divided into various categories, including:

* Disk management
* Process management
* Networking tools
* System information
* Security tools\
