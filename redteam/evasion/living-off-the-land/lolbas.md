# LOLBAS Project

# Theory

[LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/#) stands for Living Off the Land Binaries And Scripts, a project's primary main goal is to gather and document the Microsoft-signed and built-in tools used as  Living Off the Land techniques, including binaries, scripts, and libraries.

The LOLBAS project is a community-driven repository gathering a collection of binaries, scripts, libraries that could be used for red team purposes. It allows to search based on binaries, functions, scripts, and ATT&CK info. The previous image shows what the LOLBAS project page looks like at this time.
