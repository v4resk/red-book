# Weaponization

## Theory

Weaponization is the second stage of the [Cyber Kill Chain model](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html). In this stage, the attacker generates and develops their own malicious code using deliverable payloads such as word documents, PDFs, etc. The weaponization stage aims to use the malicious weapon to exploit the target machine and gain initial access.
