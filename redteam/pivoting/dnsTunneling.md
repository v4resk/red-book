# DNS Tunneling

## Theory

DNS Tunneling also known as **TCP over DNS**, where an attacker encapsulates other protocols, such as HTTP requests, over the DNS protocol using the [DNS Data Exfiltration technique](../exfiltration/dns.md). DNS Tunneling establishes a communication channel where data is sent and received continuously.
