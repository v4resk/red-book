# Lateral Movement 

## Theory

Lateral Movement consists of techniques that we use to enter and control remote systems on a network. Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and subsequently gaining access to it. Lateral moveement dosn't involve privilege escalation, it's just the process of pivoting.
