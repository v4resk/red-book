# Ansible Pentesting

## Theory

[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) is a powerful configuration management and automation tool widely used in DevOps to manage servers and deploy applications. However, its design and features can also make it a potential attack vector if improperly configured or abused.&#x20;

Ansible operates on a "push" model, where a control node executes tasks on remote systems using SSH. Key components include:

* **Inventory**: A list of managed nodes (targets).
* **Playbooks**: YAML files that define tasks and automation processes.
* **Modules**: Scripts used to perform specific actions (e.g., file operations, command execution).

By default, Ansible uses SSH for communication, often leveraging privileged accounts or key-based authentication.&#x20;
