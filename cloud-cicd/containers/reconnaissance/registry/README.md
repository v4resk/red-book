# Docker Registry

## Theory

Docker Registries, at their fundamental, are used to store and provide published Docker images for use. Using repositories, creators of Docker images can switch between multiple versions of their applications and share them with other people with ease.

Public registries such as DockerHub exist, however, many organisations using Docker will host their own "private" registry.
