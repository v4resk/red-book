The **Red-Book of Hack-Army** aimed to provide a technical guides on various hacking topics:

* Active Directory&#x20;
* Web Pentest
* Windows Pentest
* Linux Pentest
* Physical intrusion&#x20;
* Social engineering&#x20;
* Phishing&#x20;
* ...

The objective of this website is to provide a large wiki/knowledge base on offensive cybersecurity techniques/tricks. Most of the content that you will find here are just **copy/past** from other valuable resources on internet.&#x20;

Keep in mind that these guides was created to centralize red teaming information that i found all over the web or during CTF and real word pentesting.
